## About

This is the repository for the 2023 season. This is where we will be storing all of our code that goes on our robot. This library uses our utility library, [8840-lib](https://github.com/frc8840/8840-lib).

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

You will need to have the following installed on your computer:

• [Java 11](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jdk11-downloads.html)

• [Latest Version of WPILib](https://github.com/wpilibsuite/allwpilib/releases/tag/v2023.1.1)

• VSCode, and the WPILib extension. If you install VSCode through the extension above, it will install the extension for you. If not, you'll have to manually move the extension into your VSCode extensions folder, and edit the `extensions.json` file to include the extension. If you need help, please ask Jaiden.

• [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)
